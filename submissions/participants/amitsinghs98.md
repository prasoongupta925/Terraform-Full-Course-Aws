### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I gained a clear understanding of Infrastructure as Code and why Terraform is essential for scalable cloud management. I learned how manual provisioning leads to inconsistency, delays, and operational overhead. Terraform addresses these challenges through reusable code, automation, and version-controlled infrastructure. I also reviewed the core workflow: init, plan, apply, and destroy.

- **Issue:** [#58](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/58)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learned what Terraform is and how it enables Infrastructure as Code on AWS. I understood providers, the state file, and the basic workflow using init, plan, and apply. I also created my first AWS resource using Terraform. This gives me a clean foundation to continue the remaining challenge.

- **Issue:** [#198](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/198)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learned how Terraform stores infrastructure information inside a state file. I also configured remote state using an S3 backend. I understood the importance of state locking and learned that DynamoDB locking is now deprecated, as S3 provides built-in server-side locking. This helps in collaboration and prevents state corruption.

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learn that dev team develops features faster than ever and deployment needs to keep up. Traditional approach slows the development  because they manually provision  cloud through cloud console  and this  process cost time consuming and chances of human error are high. This is where Infrastruction as Code (IaC) tool like terrafom, changes the game, enabling automated, repeatable and reliable Infrastructure at scale.

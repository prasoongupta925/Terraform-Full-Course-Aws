- **Issue:** [#193](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/193)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learned how important the Terraform state file is as the single source of truth that tracks real cloud resources and keeps Terraform in sync with your infrastructure. I also understood why using a secure remote backend like S3 with locking and versioning is critical to avoid corruption, enable team collaboration, and protect sensitive state data.

- **Issue:** [#155](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/155)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learned how Terraform tracks every change using its state file and updates only what’s necessary with complete precision. I also understood how implicit dependencies work automatically, making infrastructure creation cleaner and more efficient.

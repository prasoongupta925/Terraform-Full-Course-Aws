### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I discovered that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) transforms infrastructure management from manual, error-prone console clicks into automated, version-controlled code. I learned that Terraform uses a simple 5-phase workflow (init, validate, plan, apply, destroy) to provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers through providers and APIs. The biggest insight was understanding how IaC enables consistency, scalability, and collaboration - allowing teams to deploy identical environments with a single codebase while tracking every change in Git. I successfully installed Terraform on my Ubuntu system and set up essential configurations like tab completion and aliases. Most importantly, I realized that treating infrastructure as code rather than manually managed resources is the foundation of modern DevOps practices.

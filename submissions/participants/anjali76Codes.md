### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today, I learned the fundamentals of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and why automating infrastructure is better than using manual GUIs. I explored different IaC tools, especially Terraform, and understood its key benefits like reusability, version control, and consistent environments. I also learned the challenges of manual provisioning, such as human errors, high costs, and dependency on infra teams. Finally, I installed Terraform on Ubuntu/WSL, set up aliases, auto-completion, and initialized my first Terraform project

- **Issue:** [#156](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/156)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

I learned how the AWS provider connects Terraform with AWS and why it's needed before creating any resources.
I figured out how the provider configuration and authentication work together.
I also got a clear idea of how Terraform manages AWS resources through the provider plugin.
Plus I went through some basic Terraform commands that help in planning and applying changes.

- **Issue:** [#249](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/249)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today I learned how to split my Terraform setup into a proper multi-file structure instead of keeping everything in one place.
I set up files for variables, locals, providers, backend and outputs so the project stays clean and easier to manage.
I also added tfvars, gitignore and example files to follow a safe workflow that works well for bigger setups.

- **Issue:** [#218](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/Terraform-Full-Course-Aws/issues/218)

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Terraform variables help avoid repetition and keep environments consistent across resources. Input variables control values from outside, locals help build clean naming patterns, and outputs return important IDs after apply. Understanding when to use each type makes the configuration easier to maintain and reduces errors. This keeps the setup flexible as the project grows.

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Today, I learned the fundamentals of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and why automating infrastructure is better than using manual GUIs. I explored different IaC tools, especially Terraform, and understood its key benefits like reusability, version control, and consistent environments. I also learned the challenges of manual provisioning, such as human errors, high costs, and dependency on infra teams. Finally, I installed Terraform on Ubuntu/WSL, set up aliases, auto-completion, and initialized my first Terraform project

### 🎯 Key Learnings

I learned how the AWS provider connects Terraform with AWS and why it's needed before creating any resources.
I figured out how the provider configuration and authentication work together.
I also got a clear idea of how Terraform manages AWS resources through the provider plugin.
Plus I went through some basic Terraform commands that help in planning and applying changes.
